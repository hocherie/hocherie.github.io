# ZSH Links
After several years of using the default bash on Mac, I began to be frustrated by the limited functionality and made the switch to zsh. 

It’s been three weeks since the switch and I’m loving every moment of it: the autosuggestion, themes, all harder to access without the original bash.

## How I switched over?
I followed two main links to get it to work. Check them out too!
* https://medium.freecodecamp.org/jazz-up-your-zsh-terminal-in-seven-steps-a-visual-guide-e81a8fd59a38

1. Install iTerm2. A macOS Terminal Replacement with loads of additional features (ex. Split panes)
2. (If you don’t have home-brew), download it. It’s useful for installing other cool applications!
Enter this in your new iTerm2!
```
xcode-select --install
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

3. Install zsh using homebrew. 
`brew install zsh`
* To test that we installed zsh correctly, type `echo $0`. It should return `zsh`.

4. Install Oh My Zsh 
`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`

5. Set zsh as your default shell environment in iTerm2.
a. Open ITerm2 -> Preferences -> Profiles -> General
c. Under Command textbox, write `/bin/zsh`
d. Restart iTerm2
e. To test the shell env has changed, type
`echo $0`. It should return `zsh`


*Congrats! By now, you have zsh successfully set up. The following are optional steps to follow to install additional extensions to really capture zsh’s potential.*
