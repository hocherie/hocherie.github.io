The video is an essential, maybe most important, part of your paper. You've already done great work getting results for a paper, so finish strong and make a good video. An impactful video is vital for fundraising, hallway chats in conferences, and publicity.
Many of these tips I have learned from [Rogerio Bonatti](http://rogeriobonatti.com/) when we made videos together on [drone filming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ookhHnqmlaU).

## Do’s
1. **DO show the best result within the first 15 seconds.**
This result’s impact should be very obvious to other roboticists. Use a few words to highlight key effects, if not obvious.
2. **DO show full story in first minute (problem, key insight, result)**
3. **DO leave at least 3 seconds per scene.**
Leave slide on for at least one sec per two words.
4. **DO make sure each scene is very obvious even without the last slide.**
We tend to skip around the video, so each scene should be stand-alone. Use a few words to caption, legends and arrows, if necessary.
5. **DO send to multiple people (other than coauthors) to review.**
Specifically ask where they got lost.

## Don'ts
1. **DON'T have more than 1 key message per scene.**
Think about your key message of your scene, and add what is necessary to deliver a message.
2. **DON’T use too much text.**
Pictures are worth 1000 words, a video is worth > 10 pictures.
3. **DON’T use small text.**
People will likely watch on their phones. Make sure everything is big enough to see on the phone.
4. **DON’T spend less than 3 iterations to make your video.**
Videos take time. Allot at least one week to reiterate.
5. **DON’T add equations / math, unless you have to.**

## Example Video Template (first minute)
Adapted from my video on Adaptive Tube Library: [Youtube Link](https://youtu.be/nrcfQx3rJnw)
1. **Title Slide (5s)**
    Title, author name, email address, logos

    <p align="center">
        <img src="/resources/assets/tube_01.png" class="video-screenshot" alt="Title Slide">
    </p>


2. **Key problem / Context (10s, if self-explanatory, skip)**
    This scene sets up the “so what” of your paper. Why should a reader care about your work? Show, don’t tell! If you can show it visually, rather than just words. This should be understandable by roboticists outside your field.
    <p align="center">
        <img src="/resources/assets/tube_02.png" class="video-screenshot" alt="Key Problem 1">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img src="/resources/assets/tube_03.png" class="video-screenshot" alt="Key Problem 2">
    </p>

3. **Key Result (10s)**
    Time to show off, use your best result. Make it obvious what your technique enables and how it addresses key problem.
    <p align="center">
        <img src="/resources/assets/tube_04.png" class="video-screenshot" alt="Key Result">
    </p>
4. **Key Insight (10s)**
    Describe visually the key insight you used to get your results. This should be similar to the Fig. 1 in your paper.
    <p align="center">
        <img src="/resources/assets/tube_05.png" class="video-screenshot" alt="Key Insight">
    </p>
5. **Under-the-hood (10s)**
    Give readers a sneak-peek of how it works behind the scene.
    This could be RVIZ, processed data.
    

    <p align="center">
        <img src="/resources/assets/tube_06.png" class="video-screenshot" alt="Under the hood 1">
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <img src="/resources/assets/tube_07.png" class="video-screenshot" alt="Under the hood 2">
    </p>
6. **Extra results (8s)**
    <p align="center">
        <img src="/resources/assets/tube_08.png" class="video-screenshot" alt="Extra Results">
    </p>
7. **Last Video (5s)**
    Leave on a high note! Use your second best result, or have a lot of results in parallel to show robustness.

8. **Title Slide (2s)**
