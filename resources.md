**Teaching about Robots**
* [**Guaranteeing Safety in the Real World**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmRl8swiEyc)<br>
    [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmRl8swiEyc)][[Slides](https://github.com/hocherie/cbf_quadrotor/blob/master/docs/ensuring-safety-pdf.pdf)][[Code](https://github.com/hocherie/cbf_quadrotor)]<br>
    This session covers the problem of ensuring safety in real world scenarios. We first introduce the problem of safety and its challenges, then briefly discuss current safety approaches. Thereafter, we introduce the mathematical approaches to safety and go through an in depth discussion of two different methods of Reachability Analysis and Control Barrier Function. In the interactive session, we go through designing a Control Barrier Function system for multi robot collision and obstacle avoidance.<br>
    Session is part of [Air Lab Summer School](https://theairlab.org/summer2020).
* [**Basics of How Robots Work**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxhO7oq3-dY)<br>
